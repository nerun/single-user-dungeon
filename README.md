# Single User Dungeon

**Single User Dungeon** is a text-based adventure with elements of tabletop RPG and sandbox games for PC. It is inspired by the old [Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon), but focused on individual play. It is assumed that this is just a game engine, not a playable game.

This game engine is being developed as from the scripts created by Tomas Varaneckas (Vilnius, Lithuania), and released on his blog [Paranoid Engineering](Http://paranoid-engineering.blogspot.com/2008/11/python-mud-game-example.html) on November 25th, 2008.

### Easy to translate

SUD is easy to translate because it uses JSON files to store information about rooms, objects, and the game interface. You can use the Poedit program, which in version 3.3+ added support for JSON files, and version 3.4 is now available as a flatpak in the Ubuntu/Mint stores.

### Requirements

* Python 3+

### Running

1. Start:
   - **Windows**: double click start.py
   - **Linux**: in terminal `python3 start.py`
2. Type "help" while in game for commands

### Known bugs

* When an object is placed in the inventory and there is already an object with the same name inside it, then that object disappears, leaving only one.
