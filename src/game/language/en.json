There are also many fishermen and villagers from the local village doing their jobs or trying to extract some coin from the newcomers.\nThe Recalcitrant Adventurer's Harbor has been the gateway for all kinds of adventurous spirits into the Realm of Shambles. Of course, this vast region does not deserve to be called a \"kingdom\" but, without a doubt, it well deserves the demeritable nickname of \"shambles\" as it is truly a lawless land. In fact, it is officially called \"vastness\", and there are many here who declare themselves kings and princes, or some other title.\nThese powers rule in city-states or small regions over which they manage to impose their authority. However, in the Realm of Shambles nothing lasts, princes fall and rise day after day.\nThe beach stretches from north to south, and to the east is the great sea through which adventurers arrive. To the west there appears to be a customs house.",
